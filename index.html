  <h1>Restaurant History</h1>
  <p>Burrito Boys…..
was founded on January 18, 1986. Gerry and Christos Stathatos purchased the assets of a struggling restaurant at
416 N. 76th street in Houston, Texas. They liked the Harrisburg/Wayside neighborhood very much , a mixture of hard
working people and small business. This they thought would be a great area for their new business.
The restaurant , renamed Burrito Boys Restaurant  opened with a new look, and an enhanced menu.
Their business was so successful, that in 1991, they added 1,000 square feet of dining area, increasing seating
capacity to 170, while adding 1,500 square feet for a larger kitchen. They then added parking across the street
from the restaurant to accommodate the additional business.
Continuing the growth of the company, Burrito Boys Inc. acquired their second location at 8385 Broadway, in Houston,
Texas in June of 1994. This became a very successful location as well.
In 2001, Burrito Boys Restaurants opened their third location at 6501 Southwest Freeway at Hillcroft in Houston,
 Texas, and in 2008, the fourth location was opened in Waco, Texas at 4651 Interstate 35 South.
Burrito Boys Restaurants was built on pride and hard work. What separates Burrito Boys from others in the restaurant
 industry, is the quality and attention to detail. Ambiance, Quality, and Service are the focus of this company.
Currently with 4 locations, Gerry and Christos plan to expand in new markets in the near future.
” You will always enjoy Great Burrito and Drinks, Great Service, and a Great Atmosphere at any of our locations.
Thank you for dining at Burrito Boys Mexican Restaurant"</p>
